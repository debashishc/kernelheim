# Kernelheim üõ†Ô∏è

Welcome to **Kernelheim** ‚Äì a powerful collection of custom Triton and CUDA kernel functions designed to optimize and accelerate machine learning workloads on **NVIDIA GPUs**. Inspired by the mythical stronghold of the gods, **Kernelheim** is a forge where high-performance kernels are crafted to unlock the full potential of your hardware.

## Overview ‚ö°

**Kernelheim** is an ongoing project aimed at delivering highly efficient, scalable, and easy-to-integrate kernel functions for machine learning and deep learning tasks, with a specific focus on **NVIDIA GPU architectures**. By leveraging Triton and CUDA, the project aims to build a suite of optimized kernels to maximize performance in GPU-accelerated machine learning workflows.

### Project Status: In Progress üöß

This project is currently under active development. The initial focus is on building foundational kernel functions that target **NVIDIA GPUs**, with optimizations for tasks such as matrix operations, custom neural network layers, and various computation-heavy processes.

More features, enhancements, and documentation will be added as development progresses.

## Features ‚ú® (Planned)

- **High-Performance Kernels**: Custom kernels optimized for NVIDIA GPUs, specifically targeting machine learning operations.
- **Triton & CUDA Integration**: Full support for both Triton and CUDA to take full advantage of NVIDIA's GPU architecture.
- **Efficient Memory Management**: Optimized memory access patterns to reduce latency and improve throughput.
- **Scalable and Modular**: Designed to be flexible, with future-proofing for additional machine learning tasks and model optimization.

## Why Kernelheim? üî•

In **Kernelheim**, we aim to **forge** kernels that harness the raw power of NVIDIA GPUs, just as the mythical gods forged their tools with divine precision. By combining **Triton** and **CUDA**, we‚Äôre building tools to help developers achieve superior machine learning performance, scalability, and efficiency on NVIDIA hardware.

## Installation üì¶ (Coming Soon)

Installation instructions will be available once the first version of the project is ready for public use.

## Usage üöÄ (Coming Soon)

Detailed usage instructions, examples, and integration guides will be provided after the initial release.

## Contributing ü§ù
